    "\n",
    "# In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class and an object are fundamental concepts that facilitate the organization and modeling of code based on real-world entities and their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class:\n",
    "# A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (data members) and behaviors (methods) that a certain type of object will have. It's like a blueprint for creating objects. In simpler terms, a class is a way to define the structure and behavior of objects of a certain type.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Object:\n",
    "# An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete realization of the class blueprint, with specific values for its attributes and the ability to perform the actions defined by its methods. Objects are the basic building blocks in OOP and represent real-world entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",

    "# # Question :- 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: \n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It provides the ability to control access to the data and restricts external entities from directly manipulating the internal state of an object. This helps in maintaining data integrity and ensuring that changes to the internal structure of an object don't affect other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction: \n",
    "Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of real-world entities. It allows you to focus on the relevant aspects of an object while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and creating a higher level of understanding of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance: \n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (superclass or base class). It enables the creation of new classes that extend or specialize the behavior of existing classes, promoting code reusability and a hierarchical structure. Subclasses inherit and can override the characteristics of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: \n",
    "Polymorphism means the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass through a unified interface. It allows you to write code that works with objects of different classes in a consistent way. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading, enabling dynamic behavior based on the actual type of the object"

    "\n",
    "# In object-oriented programming (OOP), the __init__() function is a special method, \n",
    "# often called a constructor, that is used to initialize the attributes of an object when it's created from a class. It's automatically called whenever a new instance of the class is created. \n",
    "# The purpose of the __init__() function is to set up the initial state of the object and assign values to its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialization: When an object is created, it often needs to have certain attributes with specific initial values. The __init__() function ensures that these attributes are properly initialized as soon as the object is instantiated, avoiding the need to manually set them after creating the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Default Values: The __init__() function can define default values for attributes, which are used if the values are not provided when creating the object. This makes it more convenient to create objects without specifying every attribute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attribute Setup: The __init__() function is a convenient place to perform any setup or computations that are required before an object can be used. This helps in maintaining consistency and encapsulating the logic related to object creation.\n",

    "# Question :- 4\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Instance Binding: In a class, self refers to the specific instance of the class that the method is called on. It allows you to access the instance's attributes and methods, enabling the methods to operate on the data associated with that specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Attribute Access: By using self, you can access and modify the instance's attributes within its methods. This encapsulation ensures that the methods can work with the object's internal state without affecting other instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Method Invocation: When a method is called on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method. By convention, this first parameter is named self. This allows methods to access the instance's data and interact with other methods through the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Differentiating Instance and Local Variables: Using self makes it clear that you're referring to an instance attribute rather than a local variable within the method. This helps avoid naming conflicts and ensures that you're working with the intended data."
